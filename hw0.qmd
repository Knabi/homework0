```{r}
a <- 1 
b <- 3
c <- 2
x <- seq(-5, 5, length = 300)
plot(x, a*x^2 + b*x + c, type = "l")
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
points(-1, 0, col="red", pch=19)
points(-2, 0, col="green", pch=19)
```

```{r}
# Define the coefficients of the polynomial
coefficients <- c(2, 3, 1)

# Find the roots
roots <- polyroot(coefficients)

# Print the roots
print(roots)
```

Interpretation: The plot shows a parabola, which has two real roots ($x=-1,-2$) since the discriminant ($b^2-4ac$) is greater than 0. The roots are also shown in the plot.
